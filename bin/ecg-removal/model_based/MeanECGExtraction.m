function [ECGmean,ECGsd,meanPhase] = MeanECGExtraction(x,phase,bins,flag)
%
% [ECGmean,ECGsd,meanPhase] = MeanECGExtraction(x,phase,bins,flag)
% Calculation of the mean and SD of ECG waveforms in different beats
%
% inputs:
% x: input ECG signal
% phase: ECG phase
% bins: number of desired phase bins
% flag
%     1: aligns the baseline on zero, by using the mean of the first 10%
%     segment of the calculated mean ECG beat
%     0: no baseline alignment
%
% outputs:
% ECGmean: mean ECG beat
% ECGsd: standard deviation of ECG beats
% meanPhase: the corresponding phase for one ECG beat
